# Responsible Disclosures

RIPEDA Consulting is committed to responsible disclosures of security vulnerabilities we discover. This is why we follow [Google's Project Zero guidelines](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-policy.html) for responsible disclosures, specifically the 90+30 disclosure deadline policy.

What this means is that a vendor has 90 days after being initially notified about a security vulnerability to make a patch available to users. If they make a patch available within 90 days, RIPEDA will publicly disclose details of the vulnerability 30 days after the patch has been made available to users. If a vendor cannot patch an issue within the initial 90 days, RIPEDA will make the details of the vulnerability public at the end of the 90 days.

This ensures that vendors are given a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before it is made public, users have time to update and those same users are informed about the issue in a timely manner. This ensures vendors are held accountable for the security of their products, and that users are protected from known security vulnerabilities.
