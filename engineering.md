RIPEDA Consulting specializes in Apple device management, and thus we have a deep understanding of Apple's platforms inside and out. Our expertise includes:

| - Swift |
| - Objective-C |
| - C/C++ |
| - Python |
| - ZSH and Bash |
| |

Our entire infrastructure is built with resiliency and automation in mind through continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. We let the computers do what they're best at, so our team can focus on what they're best at: solving your problems.

# Commitment to Open Source

As a company, we greatly benefit from open-source projects to get our work done. And in return, we make contributions back to many of these same projects as well as open-sourcing some of our utilities right on [GitHub](https://github.com/ripeda)!
