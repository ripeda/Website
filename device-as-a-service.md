# Device as a Service

Deploying new machines can be a hassle and expensive. With RIPEDA's Device as a Service (DaaS) offering, we take care of the entire process for you. We'll work with you to determine the best hardware for your needs, procure the devices, and deploy them to your users. We also offer buybacks for applicable devices and can handle the disposal of old hardware in an environmentally friendly way.

All this for a simple monthly fee per device. No more large capital expenditures for new hardware, just a predictable monthly cost. After the contract term ends, you have the option to buy out the device at a reduced cost, or continue and receive a brand-new device.

And if an employee breaks a device, our [in-house repair](../repairs) will have it covered including a complimentary loaner device. All Macs and Apple TVs come with 3 years of AppleCare+ coverage, and 2 years for iPads and iPhones.

*Serving Alberta businesses in Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Lethbridge and surrounding areas with expert Apple device management.*
